> This seminar is designed to explore, discuss and develop sound-focused
> studies of literary works, events and performances in a manner that
> draws connections between the fields of literary studies and sound
> studies. The past 20+ years have yielded a rich field of critical work
> that explores the relationship between literature and sound, both on
> and off the page, going back to the edited collections of Adelaide
> Morris (*Sound States*, 1997) and Charles Bernstein (*Close
> Listening*, 1998), to the special issue of *ESC* edited by Louis Cabri
> and Peter Quartermain (*On Discreteness: Event and Sound in Poetry*,
> 33.4 2007), up to recent studies by Katherine Robson (*Heartbeats:
> Everyday Life and the Memorized Poem* 2012), Raphael Allison (*Bodies
> on the Line*, 2014*)*, Matthew Rubery (*The Untold Story of the
> Talking Book*, 2016), Jennifer Stoever (*The Sonic Color Line*, 2016),
> Jason Camlot (*Phonopoetics*, 2019), among many others. This body of
> criticism has explored how sound, hearing and listening have been
> represented in literary works of different periods, and, increasingly,
> has focused on the cultural significance of literary representation,
> production, and performance when it is manifest *as* sound in events
> and documentary recordings of literary performances, readings,
> storytelling, sound poetry, and literary sound art. *Sound Studies* is
> an interdisciplinary field of research and theory that focuses on
> audible events and their related social, institutional and
> technological contexts. It deploys methods of inquiry from media
> history (Jonathan Sterne, Lisa Gitelman), cultural studies (David
> Morton; Jacob Smith; Emily Thompson), philosophy and phenomenology
> (Don Ihde; SalomÃ© Voegelin; James Steintrager and Rey Chow),
> disability studies (Mara Mills; Michele Freidner and Stefan
> Helmreich), Indigenous studies (Dylan Robinson), critical race studies
> (Nina Eidsheim; Nicole Furlonge), film studies (Michel Chion),
> rhetoric (Steph Cesaro), among many others. It also represents a
> significant, emergent branch of digital humanities that focuses on
> methods of analyzing and presenting audio signals in digital
> environments (Tanya Clement; Damon Krukowski). *Literary* sound
> studies, the still speculative interdisciplinary field of theories and
> interpretive methods we will explore, approaches literary history and
> poetics through engagement with new sonic concepts and entities,
>
> and potentially opens a range of new approaches to researching,
> conceptualizing, and understanding "the literary" and literary
> cultures.
>
> **Texts*:*

> *Content notes for Claudia Rankine's Citizen: An American Lyric and
> situation videos, Tanya Tagaq's Split Tooth, and Jordan Abel's Nishga:
> These important works engage directly with accounts of racism,
> violence, sexual violence, psychological abuse, and other traumatizing
> events that may be difficult hear and cope with. Please put your own
> self-care first. If you feel you are having difficulty reading or
> imagining discussing one or more of these works, please let me know

> *What the above list of requirements means*:
>
> *Participation:* Attendance counts as part of the participation grade,
> as you cannot participate if you are not prepared, and present to
> listen and engage. Come to class prepared by having done the required
> reading(s) and listening, and with notes (that I recommend you keep in
> a single file or notebook for this course) that can inform our work
> together. We'll listen and respond to each other attentively,
> generously and respectfully. One part of the engagement aspect of
> participation will be rotation in leading a *weekly Pauline Oliveros*
> Deep Listening *warm up prompt*: Each week, one seminar participant
> will select ONE listening prompt from Pauline Oliveros's book, *Deep
> Listening*, and either (1) try out leading us in the selected practice
> practice prompt for a few minutes, (2) lead a short
> reflection/discussion about what they like about the selected prompt
> and what they think it can accomplish (if given more time), or (3)
> invent a short practice prompt of their own based on one found in
> Oliveros's book and explain it to us. These opening exercises will
> last about 5 minutes total (quick warm up exercises). They will be a
> way of getting into the spirit of the class each week. Usually the
> roles of "Oliveros prompt warm up leader" and "listening practice
> guide" will not overlap in the same week.
>
> *Guided Listening Practice:* For most classes one or two students will
> be designated to serve as "Listening Practice Guide" and will lead
> discussion in one sound recording assigned for that day, with the goal
> of directing the rest of the class in exploration of aspects of the
> texts according to a line of thinking, argument, or
> exegesis-in-progress developed by the guide(s), *for a period of
> approximately* *20-30 minutes*. These are NOT formal papers and *are
> not to be read*, although you may refer to notes. As Listening
> Practice Guide your responsibilities are, 1. To provide some *set-up /
> context* for the sound recording -- whatever seems important to help
> position us in relation to the recording; 2. To *Conceptualize and
> articulate some "pre-listening" questions* you have about the
> recording that you think will be interesting to share with the rest of
> us, and to explore together in conversation. These questions will
> guide our listening in particular directions and will work to shape
> our listening responses that we'll begin to express via the zoom chat
> function, while listening. 3. *Play the recording or some strategic
> selections from it.* We will all listen together and take notes and
> comments while listening, as guided by your pre-listening questions.
> 4. *Guide discussion following our group listening,* which entails
> responding to questions and comments that arise after we listen, and
> bringing at least one concept from a reading listed on our syllabus
> into the conversation for us to consider in relation to the sounds
>
> that we've heard. Throughout the listening practice, I will be serving
> as moderator and will assist in playing audio (if you want),
> participating in guiding the conversation, and keeping time.
>
> *Short Context and Analysis Assignment:* You may choose to do ONE of
> the following assignments, each of which asks that you engage in
> practices of contextualization and analysis. Assignments should not
> exceed *five (5) pages* in length.

- Critical Annotation of an Audiotext

> Audiotexts are somewhat more difficult to work with than print texts
> due to the fact that they are not static and visual like printed
> words. You can't write on them, cut and paste them in a word
> processor, or quote them directly, with any real ease, in a written
> essay. But wouldn't it be useful to be able to create annotations that
> are somehow identifiably linked to an audio file, so that a listener
> can draw upon your notes, comments, analytical annotations, to better
> understand what they are listening to. In this assignment you will
> engage in producing a critical annotation of an audiotext, with the
> use of one or more digital tools to help you. You may choose to use an
> open source transcription software that allows you to add timestamped
> notes as you listen to a file, or the annotation function in software
> like Audacity. You may go at it old school and simply listen to the
> audiotext and manually note down the time stamps where you wish to
> make annotations. Or, you may embark on learning how to use a tool
> like *AudiAnnotate* which allows you to generate a IIIF manifest that
> displays annotations that you have previously made using Audacity in
> an online interface. While this last example may not mean anything to
> you, I can arrange for you to meet with an expert in AudiAnnotate who
> can show you how it all works. You may approach the content of your
> annotations in any number of ways, whether as editorial notes that
> help explain and contextualize moments in the recording, or as more
> interpretive or analytical notes that build up an argument about the
> audiotext in selected durational intervals. This assignment represents
> a form of critical listening. The audio selection should be short
> enough so that your annotations do not exceed 5 pages in length.

- Audio Pedagogy Prompt and Lesson Plan

> In no more than four (4) pages develop a lesson plan for teaching a
> literary sound recording of your choice in an undergraduate lecture
> class. First set up the scenario of the class (what level, what
> course, what context for bring in a sound recording), some of the
> primary aims in using the sound recording at this point in the class,
> and then outline the approach you would take in answer to some of the
> following questions: What approach(es) would you use to introduce the
> recording, and set up ideas for how your students should listen to it?
> What other thinkers or texts might refer to in your lecture? What
> passages (clips) from the recording would be most useful for
> explaining the points you want to make and why?
>
> What lines of questioning would you develop to get them thinking and
> engaged? What other presentation strategies would you use to help make
> your lecture effective? Your assignment may consist of an outline of
> your planned activities, but should consist mainly of an essay about
> how you would teach this audio recording in a lecture class to
> undergraduates (of whatever level you specify).

- Table of Contents and Preface to textbook on *Literary Sound Studies*

> Your assignment is to select between five and ten scholarly articles
> (from the syllabus, or beyond) and arrange them as the content for
> your textbook for a field called "Literary Sound
>
> Studies". Then, write a 4-5 page preface that explains what literary
> sound studies is, with reference to some or all of the articles you
> selected for your edited collection. Reccommended preperatory reading
> for this assignment would include Sterne's *Sound Studies Reader*,
> Morris's *Sound States*, and Bernstein's *Close Listening*.

- Library Literary Media Kit Description and Contextualization

> In the Concordia library, on the shelf marked MEDIA KITS/TROUSSES
> MULTIMEDIAS (PC2065- PS8253) you will discover educational media kits
> in archaiv media formats (like audio cassette) designed for learning
> languages, and also for the study of literature. Select ONE media kit
> from 1990 or earlier that was acquired by the library to assist in the
> study of poetry (not languages, not drama, etc.). Write a brief
> historical/cultural analysis of the kit. This analysis may ask why the
> kit was designed, why it was acquired, how it might have been used,
> and even more interestingly, how the kit materializes certain ideas,
> assumptions or aspirations about the relationship between the study of
> literature, voice, performance, reading, and listening. What kinds of
> instructors and students does the literary media kit imagine. How is
> the kit a material trace of some timebound idea of "the literary" as a
> form of encounter, somehow still hanging in a plastic bag on a shelf
> in the library? Be sure to pay attention to details of all materials
> found in the kit, and feel free to go to town in your analysis of a
> seemingly inconsequential element that you notice, if you feel it may
> indeed indicate something relevant about the object as a historical
> trace of a pedagogical, literary or sonic ideation of interest.

- Audio Artifact Description and Contextualization

> In the AMPLab for Sound Studies and Literature you will find a small,
> eclectic selection of spoken word audio artifacts (LP records and
> cassette tapes), much as you might find in a Salvation Army thrift
> store. You are invited to select one item from the AMPLab collection
> (or go to a thrift store and find your own literary/spoken word
> recording), and then embark on some research about it so that you can
> provide a historically contextualizing cultural interpretation of the
> literary audio artifact you have chosen to examine. While the audible
> content of the recording may be of value to your short study of the
> artifact (and you can listen to it using the record player or tape
> machine in the lab), you may find that the information on the record
> sleeve or tape case is just as useful for developing an historical
> account, and cultural interpretation of the significance of the
> artifact you have selected. Who made the artifact? When was it made?
> Why was it made?
>
> How have they packaged, framed, discursively set up the consumption of
> that artifact? Who is their imagined audience? What is the
> significance of this historical audio artifact today (from a cultural,
> literary, media historical, performative, political, etc.
> perspective)?

- Remediation and Audio Format Analysis

> (As noted in the previous assignment prompt): In the AMPLab for Sound
> Studies and Literature you will find a small, eclectic selection of
> spoken word audio artifacts (LP and cassette tapes), much as you might
> find in a Salvation Army thrift store. You are invited to select one
> item from the AMPLab collection (or go to a thrift store and find your
> own literary/spoken word recording), and then proceed to digitize part
> or all the recording (using equipment in the AMPLab). Once digitized,
> you will have two sound objects held in different audio formats. In a
> short essay (5pp), analyse the significance of this fact. What has
> happened to the sound object (the audible signal) that was held on a
> record or tape and is now on a hard drive as a WAV or MP3 file? What
> difference do the media formats make to the sounds themselves? What
> has been lost, what has been gained by the process of remediation?
> This assignment may lead you to delve into format
>
> studies (see Sterne, *MP3*), theories of the sound object (see Chow
> and Steintrager, *Sound Objects*), theories of remediation (see Bolter
> and Grusin), or any number of media historical approaches relevant to
> such an analysis. You must cite at least two relevant critical sources
> in your essay.
>
> *Shortform Podcast (A Critical Sound Work, spoken and recorded)*: For
> this assignment you will be required to produce a short audio talk
> with accompanying sound as a 4-6 minutes-long (maximum!)
> sound-recorded exploration of one of the main ideas you have developed
> in relation to a "literary" sound of your choice (and that you may
> also decide explore further in your final paper or longform scholarly
> podcast, if you like). Your podcast does not need to adhere to any
> particular podcast format. It will be an audio work of some kind,
> involving sound, critical analysis, sonic examples, and talk. In this
> Podcast / Critical Sound Work you will need to: a) present a main
> idea/argument/concept to be explored, and b) integrate at least one
> sound other than that of your own voice as illustration of, or sonic
> support for, the idea you have chosen to explore or present in your
> short talk. In other words, you'll produce a sonic exploration of an
> idea you are working on developing. In addition to the short sound
> recording (in mp3 format), you will also submit a script of your
> Shortform Podcast, that will include the text you speak, and
> indications of the sounds you have integrated into the recording. The
> sound work you create may use any number of spoken audio genres
> (radio, audio essay, podcast, radio play, audio collage) as
> inspiration for its approach, and may integrate whatever accompanying
> sounds seem useful to make the goal to present an idea effective in
> audio format. We will discuss this assignment at some length, in and
> out of class, including some of the basic tools (recorder and
> software) you will need to produce this assignment. Your podcast (and
> script) must be completed and submitted to me using wetransfer by noon
> on Wednesday, December 7th. We will hold a listening session and
> discussion of all the podcasts that afternoon. Criteria I'll use to
> evaluate the shortform critical sound work are explained in a PDF
> available in the "General" (first) frame on the moodle site.
>
> *Final Project (Two Options):*
>
> *OPTION 1 - Final Paper (with accompanying slides)*: This may emerge
> out of materials and concepts you began to explore in your listening
> practice or shortform podcast, or it may be something that has emerged
> from other readings and sounds (within or without the course). In any
> case, your final seminar paper should develop a theory or reading of a
> cultural artifact (a work of literature, a material object, an event,
> etc.) so that a persuasive thesis and illustration of that thesis is
> effectively presented in a written work of *6-8 pages double spaced*
> (which is the typical length of a 15-20-minute conference paper),
> *plus 2-4 slides*. You should write your paper and prepare your slides
> with the idea of presenting it in an engaging way to a scholarly
> audience at a conference.
>
> OPTION 2 -- *Final Longform Podcast* (and transcript). Like the final
> paper, this final audio essay may emerge out of materials and concepts
> you began to explore in the listening practice you led, or in your
> shortform podcast, or it may be something that has emerged from other
> readings and sounds (within or without the course). Your final seminar
> paper should develop a theory or reading of a cultural artifact (a
> work of literature, a material object, an event, etc.) so that a
> persuasive thesis and illustration of that thesis is effectively
> presented in an audio work of 40-60 minutes in length. You
>
> should approach the making of this longform podcast with proposal for
> publication to the *SpokenWeb* *Podcast* series, in mind.
>
> You are invited (indeed, expected) to talk to me during office hours
> about your proposed Shortform Podcastt and final project sometime
> during the term, but no later than the week of November 24th (WEEK
> 12). I will distribute and post a signup sheet for meetings about
> these final assignments a few weeks before. The final paper is DUE
> Thursday, December 15th.
>
> Other relevant points of information:
>
> *Language*: Assignments may be completed in English or French.
>
> *Wellness*: Our work together is important, but the circumstances (due
> to the persistence of the effects of COVID-19 precautions and
> restrictions) under which we are pursuing this work may prove
> stressful at times. Wellness is a priority. If we find the demands of
> the course are too much under the circumstances, we'll make
> adjustments accordingly. If you are having difficulty at some point
> during the semester and need to take care of yourself, please just
> check in with me and let me know.
>
> *Respect*: It is my intent for students from all backgrounds and
> perspectives to feel safe and be well served in our seminar. I see the
> diversity in gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status,
> ethnicity, race, religion, and culture that we bring to our seminar as
> a resource, strength and benefit. As we proceed, I hope you will feel
> free to let me know of ways to improve the effectiveness of the course
> for you personally or for other students.
>
> *Content*: Some content in the materials we will read and listen to
> may be experienced as difficult and disturbing. I have done my best to
> indicate such instances in the syllabus. If you need to opt out of a
> reading or listening for your own sense of safety and well-being, that
> is fine.
>
> *Plagiarism*: This is defined in Concordia's *Academic Code of
> Conduct* as "the presentation of the work of another as one's own or
> without proper acknowledgement." Familiarize yourself with the Code
> and an extended definition of plagiarism at the Student hub page
> concerned with *Academic* *Integrity*. There is also a GradProSkills
> Workshop called "Avoiding Plagiarism at the Graduate Level" available
