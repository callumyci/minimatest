Literature and The Audiotext (ENGL 603/2) - September 2000Jason Camlot A
new field is emerging in literary studies, one that is concerned not
only with the implicit aural qualities of literature, but also with the
technologies by which the sounds of literature are made manifest. Our
work in this seminar will focus on the implications of a critical
practice that distinguishes between words that are read (silently), and
words that are heard. We will consider critical attempts to define the
differences between an oral culture and a print culture, and will
examine the implications for this criticism of the fact that our ears
and voices are now extended and mediated by an array of new sound
technologies (analog and digital recording machines), which represent an
alternate, "secondary" domain of orality. A key element of this course
will be the development of a critical vocabulary for analyzing the
audible acoustic elements of a performed work of literature within its
larger cultural context. In a recent collection of essays entitled,
Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word (1998), Charles Bernstein
proposes the term "audiotext" for the cultural artifact in question. His
term emphasizes the interplay between the written and the oral that will
be at the core of our efforts in this seminar, and highlights as its
primary critical activity the act of careful, interpretive listening,
applied with the same close attention and analysis we use to engage
written works. Working from the "sound texts" of a custom-made
course-CD, we will analyze the audio productions of literary works
ranging from the earliest recordings made in England of Victorian
celebrities, to the Caedmon poetry recordings of the 1930-50s, to the
Beats and more recent experiments in recorded "spoken-word" and poetic
soundscapes. In addition to reading theories of orality and literacy,
and analyzing the spoken performances of literature, we will also study
literary texts that themselves thematize the oral (i.e.Â those of Shaw &
Beckett), thus giving written literature its own "voice" upon the
subject of our seminar.Required Texts:T.S. Eliot, The Wasteland and
